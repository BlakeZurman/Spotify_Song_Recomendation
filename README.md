This project demonstrates a collection of Data Science techniques using R. These include Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Support Vector Machines, Euclidean Distance, and K-Means Clustering.  
The goal of this project was to choose a topic I am interested in and utilize what I've learned in grad school to generate insights.  
This project accomplishes these goals and showcases them in a professional manner, demonstrating my presentation skills.

While this project may seem simple to a seasoned data scientist, my ambition was to focus on the fundamentals and exercise good practice in problem-solving.  
I'm only a quarter of the way through my grad school journey, and I'm excited to expand on this knowledge.
